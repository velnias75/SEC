# SEC - Super Easy Chairs

Turn any stairs to sittable chairs by just putting a `redstone block` under it, or just by powering the block under the chair with redstone.

### Instalation

Just drop the `jar` into your plugins folder, thats all. No configuration!

### Building
After *checkout/clone* do
`git submodule update --init --recursive` once, than `./gradlew clean build`.
